	    <p>The <b>Election Results</b> application provides election results information to the general public and other interested parties. It offers a map-based view of election results that allows users to locate an address or voting precinct and review election results summarized in a bar chart in the information panel at the bottom of the application.</p>
	    <h4><u>Using the Application</u></h4>
	    <p>The Election Polling Places application offers a simple way for interested parties to discover election results. When you find an address or precinct, the application will select the appropriate voting precinct and highlight it on the map.  Results for relevant political contests will be presented in a series of information pods at the bottom of the application. In addition, interested parties can then click on one of political contests along the bottom of the application and interact with the map to see results for each precinct.</p>
        <h4><u>Finding an Area of Interest</u></h4>
        <p>There are three primary ways to identify an area of interest. You can interact directly with the map and click on a precinct when you've located one you're interested in.

Click on the item in the list to locate the address on the map<br />3. Or, click the precinct button and enter the precinct you're interested in<br />4. Click on the item in the list to locate the precinct on the map</p>
        <h4><u>Election Results Information</u></h4>
        <p>After searching for a respective address or precinct, the voting precinct will be highlighted on the map. At the same time, relevant results for relevant political contests will be presented in a tab at the bottom of the application. You can also select a political contest from the list at the bottom of the application and interact with the map to see results for a specific precinct.</p>
        <h4><u>Share Your Map</u></h4>
        <p>You can click on the Share Map button to share your map several different ways.  You can compose an email, post to your Facebook wall or post a Tweet. When you use the Facebook or Twitter links, you'll be asked to sign in to your respective account.</p>
